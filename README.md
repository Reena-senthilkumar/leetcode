# 🌟 From 😨 Fear to 🤩 Fun – My LeetCode Journey with ChatGPT

✨ A few months ago, solving LeetCode problems felt intimidating.  
Time complexity? Space complexity? I didn’t even look at those! I just wanted correct answers.  
But today — I’m solving problems daily, understanding logic deeply, and enjoying the entire process. 💻✨

### 🚀 Day 50: 158 Problems Solved

What began as hesitation is now a habit — and here’s how I made it happen:

---

## 👩‍💻 My Workflow

🔹 Every day, I ask **ChatGPT** for **easy-level LeetCode problems** with direct links.  
🔹 I visit the problem page and **try solving it on my own** first.  
🔹 If I get stuck:  
 — I check the **top 3 GitHub solutions** for patterns.  
 — Or I paste my wrong code into ChatGPT and ask, “What’s wrong?”

## 🤝 How ChatGPT Supports Me

ChatGPT has been more than a code assistant — it’s like a **coding partner** who:

✅ Identifies bugs in my logic  
✅ Suggests optimizations and efficient approaches  
✅ Helps me understand **time and space complexity**  
✅ Encourages me when I feel stuck  
✅ Keeps track of what I’ve already solved and recommends what’s next

With this support, I’ve built more confidence, solved problems faster, and understood coding concepts deeply.

## ⏰ My Daily Routine

✅ Morning: Solve one LeetCode problem (6:30 AM–7:15 AM)  
✅ Evening: Solve another (or more based on difficulty)  
✅ Daily commit to **GitHub** with clean Java solutions  
✅ Review of time & space complexity

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

I used to fear:
- HashSet 🫣
- HashMap 😟  
Now I use them with confidence! 😎  
I’ve also tackled a wide range of problems using:
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Collections  
- Sorting & Searching

## 📌 My Current Focus
- Mastering easy-level problems  
- Building clean, efficient Java code  
- Understanding patterns that help in interviews  
- Preparing for medium-level problems with courage

## 💬 Final Thoughts

> “It’s not about how fast you solve, it’s about how consistent you are.”

Thanks to my daily discipline, GitHub tracking, and ChatGPT’s brilliant feedback — I’ve gone from being afraid of DSA to enjoying it every day. 🚀

This is just the beginning — and I’m so excited for what’s ahead.
