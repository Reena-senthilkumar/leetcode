# üåü From üò® Fear to ü§© Fun ‚Äì My LeetCode Journey with ChatGPT

‚ú® A few months ago, solving LeetCode problems felt intimidating.  
Time complexity? Space complexity? I didn‚Äôt even look at those! I just wanted correct answers.  
But today ‚Äî I‚Äôm solving problems daily, understanding logic deeply, and enjoying the entire process. üíª‚ú®

### üöÄ Day 50: 158 Problems Solved

What began as hesitation is now a habit ‚Äî and here‚Äôs how I made it happen:

## üë©‚Äçüíª My Workflow

üîπ Every day, I ask **ChatGPT** for **easy-level LeetCode problems** with direct links.  
üîπ I visit the problem page and **try solving it on my own** first.  
üîπ If I get stuck:  
‚ÄÉ‚Äî I check the **top 3 GitHub solutions** for patterns.  
‚ÄÉ‚Äî Or I paste my wrong code into ChatGPT and ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

## ü§ù How ChatGPT Supports Me

ChatGPT has been more than a code assistant ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a **coding partner** who:

‚úÖ Identifies bugs in my logic  
‚úÖ Suggests optimizations and efficient approaches  
‚úÖ Helps me understand **time and space complexity**  
‚úÖ Encourages me when I feel stuck  
‚úÖ Keeps track of what I‚Äôve already solved and recommends what‚Äôs next

With this support, I‚Äôve built more confidence, solved problems faster, and understood coding concepts deeply.

## ‚è∞ My Daily Routine

‚úÖ Morning: Solve one LeetCode problem (6:30 AM‚Äì7:15 AM)  
‚úÖ Evening: Solve another (or more based on difficulty)  
‚úÖ Daily commit to **GitHub** with clean Java solutions  
‚úÖ Review of time & space complexity

## üß† What I‚Äôve Learned So Far

I used to fear:
- HashSet ü´£
- HashMap üòü  
Now I use them with confidence! üòé  
I‚Äôve also tackled a wide range of problems using:
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Collections  
- Sorting & Searching

---

## üìå My Current Focus
- Mastering easy-level problems  
- Building clean, efficient Java code  
- Understanding patterns that help in interviews  
- Preparing for medium-level problems with courage

## üìö Explore My Work

- [üìÅ GitHub Repository ‚Äì All My Solutions](https://lnkd.in/gUNDF8F4)  
- [üß† LeetCode Profile](https://lnkd.in/gbVRWB_h)

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about how fast you solve, it‚Äôs about how consistent you are.‚Äù

Thanks to my daily discipline, GitHub tracking, and ChatGPT‚Äôs brilliant feedback ‚Äî I‚Äôve gone from being afraid of DSA to enjoying it every day. üöÄ

This is just the beginning ‚Äî and I‚Äôm so excited for what‚Äôs ahead.
